Hexagon mudlib
==============

A project to make the original [ccmudlib](http://www.ciudadcapital.net)
and other MudOS-alike mud libraries (like the ones from _Final
Realms_ or _Discworld_) work with a modern [DGD](https://github.com/dworkin/dgd) mud driver.

### More detailed information about the project
* Current project status and roadmap in the [roadmap document](docs/roadmap.md).
* Detailed compatibility information about every function in the [compatibility document](docs/compatibility.md).

### How to use or test the mudlib

Take a look to the [installation instructions](install/readme.md), it explains how to install,
configure and execute the Hexagon mudlib using different methods.
* a) [Compiling it yourself](install/readme.md): Compiling the DGD driver and
  executing it in a Unix environment (Unix, Linux, OS X, etc)
* b) [Using a virtual machine](install/vm/readme.md): Install a VirtualBox
  virtual machine already configured using vagrant.
* c) Using a Docker container (document yet to be written).
