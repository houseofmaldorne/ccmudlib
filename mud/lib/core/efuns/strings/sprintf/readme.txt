This is my sprintf  () package. It imitates all C's  sprintf possibilities (as
long  as  it make  sense  in  LPC)  and  several other  flags  and  conversion
characters. As a bonus, it has the posibilities of strftime as well.

A manual of all its possibilities is included.

Note that sprintf is  an LPC program, NOT an extension to  the driver. All you
need to do unpack the files and place the *.c and *.h files together somewhere
in your mudlib. Then inherit sprintf. Do NOT try to change the driver sources.
