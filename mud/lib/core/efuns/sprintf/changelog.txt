v 1.4.0 neverbot@ccmud, march, 2014

- Making it work with DGD 1.5
- switch/Case -> case
- old extra.c included in sprintf.c
- Made possible to include the file from auto.c instead of inheriting it.

v 1.3.0 Released April 6, 1995

v 1.2.0 Released December 23, 1994.

- In time.c #include <config.h> -> #include "config.h"  [Drevreck]
- Removed my xs4all address from the README file, as it is no longer valid.
- Fixed a typo in an error message.
- Oops! Typo in extra.c made characters only be lowercase if they were 'a'
  or in the upper range. Similar, characters were only uppercase if 'A' or
  in the upper range.

v 1.1.0 Released August 9. 1994. First official release.

- Made mkmapping in extra.c. mkmapping is not a kfun. Also changed the
  arguments. Now just one array is passed, and the values in the resulting
  array will be 1.
- Removed use of member_array (not a kfun) in time.c. Made similar function
  index in extra.c.
- Renamed m_indices and m_values (not kfuns) to map_indices and map_values.
- Renamed file_name (not a kfun) to object_name.
* version 1.1.1.
- Merged a few statements.
* version 1.1.2.
- Changed email address to abigail@mars.ic.iaf.nl.
- Removed # define __UPPER_CASE__ from the config file as it wasn't used.
- Right justified the doc file.
- Merged a few more statements.
- Renamed some SYM_undefs to SYM_controls in sym_names.h
* version 1.1.3.
- Added 'SP' to the # defined guards in the .h files, as it was generating
  nameclashes with the Deimos mudlib.
- Changed some typos in the doc file.
- Added credits to K & R in the doc file, since parts of the doc file were
  copied from their description of sprintf.
- Adjusted the timezone calculation for the upcoming changes in the DST rules
  for (parts of) Europe in 1996. I still don't know in which year the current
  DST rules were first used.
- Added an 'installation' section in the doc file. Copied into a separate
  file as well.
- Typo fix in sym_names.h
- Added a note in the readme file that this is LPC, not a driver extension.
  (Why do lots of people think you cannot simulate sprintf in LPC?)
- Added comments in the Copyright file. (What GPL allows you & suggestion
  what to do if you use this commercially)
- Renamed SYM_control_g to SYM_control_f, as e is followed by f, not g.

v 1.0.0 Released (Igor only) April 1994.

- Added '|' flag: center argument.
- Changed ':' conversion char to '@'. ':' is too common. Maybe this should
  become a configurable option?
- Added '%y' conversion: print any type.
- Added '`' flag: reverse string.
- Made function give_padding (), to speed up padding in align () and
  numerical () (Of course, the speed up is only noticeable if you want
  to pad 10000 spaces, but nevertheless, if your strings padded with
  that many spaces, sprintf () isn't going to lag your mud.)
- '%q' will now print any result.
- Added '%R' and '%r': encryption mode.
- Added '%H' and '%h': hex-mode.
- Added '&' flag: rot 13.
- # define __FLOATS__ added in config.h
- Made # defines for intp, stringp, etc as they are no longer kfuns in DGD.
- # define nump (arg). True if arg an int, or arg a float and __FLOATS__
  # defined (note that and binds stronger than or).
- %s and %a now accept floats if __FLOATS__ is # defined.
- Made version.h file, moved appropriate # defines into it.
- Made sym_names.h file, added islower/isupper/tolower/toupper and
  changed capitalize/lower_case/upper_case/flip_case to use them. (extra.c)
- capitalize/lower_case/upper_case/flip_case adapted for ISO-LATIN-1
  character set.
- Added do_float (). It handles all %f, %e, %E, %g and %G conversations.
  Note, it uses constructs available in DGD 1.0.7.7 for the first time.
- Added copyright messages, it is distributed under the GNU Public Licence.
- Removed map_array () from anything (). map_array () isn't a DGD kfun.
  As a side-effect, the function is private in stead of static.
- Removed 'public' modifiers. sprintf () is static.
