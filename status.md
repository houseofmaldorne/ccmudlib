###Project status and roadmap

- [ ] **MudOS compatibility layer**

    Being done, see the [MudOS compatibility status document](status_compat.md) for more detailed information about each function.

- [x] Include the **AuroraMud command (cmds) system**

    Done. This will help test and debug everything as new commands are ported.

- [x] **Test and document** the current status of the project

    Being done, as you can see both in this document and in the [MudOS compatibility status document](status_compat.md).

- [ ] **heart_beats**

    Idea (*improvement from MudOS*): have different priority lists for different `hbs`: every second, every two seconds (default), every five seconds, etc.

- [ ] **Rooms and movement**

    Environment, inventory and `move`: done.
